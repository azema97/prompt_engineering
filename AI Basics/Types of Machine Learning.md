# ðŸ¤– Types of Machine Learning

---

### Supervised Learning

- Give the algorithm the output variable.
- Use: When you have well defined input data.
- At Microsoft: Spam email identification.

### Unsupervised Learning

- Do not give the algorithm output variable.
- You are exploring data and trying to find patterns.
- Use: When you do not know how to label or classify the data.
- At Microsoft: Marketing segmentation.

### Reinforced Learning

- Algorithm learns to perform a task by rewards from actions taken.
- Use: When you cannot collect data from all scenarios; the algorithm needs to learn by interacting with the environment. 
- At Microsoft: Lead qualification, cross-upsell recommendations, and escalation predictions.

Quick Summary:
- Supervised learning: You select the relationships for AI review.
- Unsupervised learning: The AI finds patterns on its own.
- Reinforcement learning: You provide the strategies, and the AI manages tactics.
