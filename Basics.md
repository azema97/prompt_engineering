# Prompt Engineering - Basics

Prompting is the process of communicating with LLM by entering queries or instructions in natural language. The quality of the prompt significantly influences the relevance and accuracy of LLM's responses. When crafting prompts, it's essential to be *specific*, *clear* and *concise*. It helps LLM to generate coherent and pertinent responses.

Focus on the following four keys elements when phrasing your prompts:

1. **Goal**: What response do you want from LLM?
2. **Context**: Why do you need it and who is involved?
3. **Source**: Which information sources or samples should Copilot use?
4. **Expectations**: How should Copilot response to best meet your expectations?

Here is an example using all four ingredients:
